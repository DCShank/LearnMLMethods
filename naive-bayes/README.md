This is supposed to do naive bayes classification or something.

Current iteration may work. I need a more complex data set to test it on.
I think the only reasonable attribute for the baseball data is number of atBats,
and for a large chunk of those the only answer is CHN. Checking 200 gave PHI, so
it doesn't always produce the same answer.

That's the other problem with my current testing, I've only tried it for one
attribute.

At a slightly later date I'll try making the year of the play an attribute. After
that I'll try to get a data set with more attributes and cut out some testing data.
